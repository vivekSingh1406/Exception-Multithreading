    1. What is an Exception

    => An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program during execution.
    Java provides a robust mechanism to handle exceptions through the try-catch-finally
    blocks and the exception class hierarchy.

    java.lang.Object
      ↳ java.lang.Throwable
           ↳ java.lang.Error          (unchecked, fatal errors)
           ↳ java.lang.Exception      (checked and unchecked)
                ↳ java.lang.RuntimeException (unchecked)


    - Throwable is the superclass of all errors and exceptions.
    - Error: Serious problems that should not be caught (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError).
    - Exception: Problems that can be caught and handled.
    - Checked Exceptions (e.g., IOException, SQLException): Must be declared or handled.
    - Unchecked Exceptions (e.g., NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException): Occur at
    runtime and are usually programming bugs.
